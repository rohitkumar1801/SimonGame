# SimonGame
This project is based on a famous Simon Game.
This is a computer game of short-term memory skill.
The device creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence.
If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex and increases the game level.
Once the user fails, the game is over.
